                    Hi, my name is Johannes and I am a student at 
                    Northwestern University from Norway pursuing a major in 
                    Economics and a minor in Business Institutions. I previously 
                    played tennis competitively, playing for the Norwegian national 
                    team and Northwestern Varsity Menâ€™s Tennis team. 
                    Outside of school I enjoy hanging out with friends and playing sports.
